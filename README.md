# Udacity-Show-Me-the-Data-Structure
Project 1 at Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program

During that project, I got experience working with Stacks, Queues, Linked lists, traversing algorithms (BFS, DFS), recursion, and hash tables.

The project contains the following tasks and the MD file with implementation reasoning:
* LRU cache - build LRU cache where get and set operations take O(1)
* File recursion - find all files that match the input suffix pattern
* Huffman coding - encode and decode input message using Huffman algorithm
* Active directory - implement an efficient function to determine if a user is in a group
* Blockchain - implement a simple blockchain data structure using a linked list
* Union and intersection on Linked lists - implement union and intersection functions for linked list
