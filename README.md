# Udacity-Algos-and-DS-Project-1
Project 1 at Udacity Data structures and Algorithms nanodegree program

During that project I got experience working with Stacks, Queues, Linked lists, traversing algorithms (BFS, DFS), recursion and hash tables.

The project contains the following tasks and the md file with implementation reasoning:
* LRU cache - build LRU cache where get and set operations take O(1)
* File recursion - find all files that matches input suffix pattern
* Huffman coding - encode and decode input message using Huffman algorithm
* Active directory - implement efficient function to determine if a user is in a group
* Blockchain - implement simple blockchin data structure using linked list
* Union and intersection on Linked lists - implement union and intersection functions for linked list
